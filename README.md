CSS457FinalProject
==================

Final Project for CSS 457

Any programing you do while researching please put in "Research/<yourname>" so that we can maximize our learning.  If you need to explain something in you research put it in your .txt file.

When we start the final project we will need to start branching from master to minimize merge conflicts. (If you don't know what that means ask James)

Before you start working and coding things, if you use an IDE (such as Eclipse) you need to add the appropriate entries to the .gitignore file.  (Again if you don't know what that means ask James)  It is very important to add to the .gitignore file so that all the extra files the IDE creates don't get included in the repository.
